/*
 * This OpMode is an example driver-controlled (TeleOp) mode for the goBILDA 2024-2025 FTC
 * Into The Deep Starter Robot
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * This robot has a two-motor differential-steered (sometimes called tank or skid steer) drivetrain.
 * With a left and right drive motor.
 * The drive on this robot is controlled in an "Arcade" style, with the left stick Y axis
 * controlling the forward movement and the right stick X axis controlling rotation.
 * This allows easy transition to a standard "First Person" control of a
 * mecanum or omnidirectional chassis.
 *
 * The drive wheels are 96mm diameter traction (Rhino) or omni wheels.
 * They are driven by 2x 5203-2402-0019 312RPM Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotors.
 *
 * This robot's main scoring mechanism includes an arm powered by a motor, a "wrist" driven
 * by a servo, and an intake driven by a continuous rotation servo.
 *
 * The arm is powered by a 5203-2402-0051 (50.9:1 Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotor) with an
 * external 5:1 reduction. This creates a total ~254.47:1 reduction.
 * This OpMode uses the motor's encoder and the RunToPosition method to drive the arm to
 * specific setpoints. These are defined as a number of degrees of rotation away from the arm's
 * starting position.
 *
 * Make super sure that the arm is reset into the robot, and the wrist is folded in before
 * you run start the OpMode. The motor's encoder is "relative" and will move the number of degrees
 * you request it to based on the starting position. So if it starts too high, all the motor
 * setpoints will be wrong.
 *
 * The wrist is powered by a goBILDA Torque Servo (2000-0025-0002).
 *
 * The intake wheels are powered by a goBILDA Speed Servo (2000-0025-0003) in Continuous Rotation mode.

    To find this, we first need to consider the total gear reduction powering our arm.
    First, we have an external 20t:100t (5:1) reduction created by two spur gears.
    But we also have an internal gear reduction in our motor.
    The motor we use for this arm is a 117RPM Yellow Jacket. Which has an internal gear
    reduction of ~50.9:1. (more precisely it is 250047/4913:1)
    We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.
    The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 7125.16
    counts per rotation of the arm. We divide that by 360 to get the counts per degree.


    We use a 312 RPM Motor instead, which has a 19.2:1 gear ratio. (more precisely, it is 194481/9826:1)
    So we multiply 19.2 by 5 to get a total gear ratio of 96:1.
    The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 2688 counts per rotation of the arm.
    We divide that by 360 to get the counts per degree. Which is 7.46666666667.

        Encoders report when the motor has moved a specified angle. They send out pulses which
        only occur at specific intervals (see our ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE). This means that the
        position our arm is currently at can be expressed as a whole number of encoder "ticks".
        The encoder will never report a partial number of ticks. So we can store the position in
        an integer (or int).
        A lot of the variables we use in FTC are doubles. These can capture fractions of whole
        numbers. Which is great when we want our arm to move to 122.5Â°, or we want to set our
        servo power to 0.5.

        setTargetPosition is expecting a number of encoder ticks to drive to. Since encoder
        ticks are always whole numbers, it expects an int. But we want to think about our
        arm position in degrees. And we'd like to be able to set it to fractions of a degree.
        So we make our arm positions Doubles. This allows us to precisely multiply together
        armPosition and our armPositionFudgeFactor. But once we're done multiplying these
        variables. We can decide which exact encoder tick we want our motor to go to. We do
        this by "typecasting" our double, into an int. This takes our fractional double and
        rounds it to the nearest whole number.
